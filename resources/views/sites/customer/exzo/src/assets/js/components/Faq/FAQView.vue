        <b>How we price your books?<b>
        <hr>
        <p>Our dedicated sales representatives will help you find buyers for your used books.
Used pricing is: A-Grade (no markings) textbooks are 90% of new textbook price, and B-Grade is 85%.  Our sales commission is 15% of your selling price.
E.g.  if a new textbook online is R100, then  A-Grade it will be R90,  R13.50 commission, and R87,50 paid to you.
Or if you sell the same R100 new textbook as B-Grade, then your selling price on our Web will be R85, our commission will be R12,75,  and you will receive R72,25.</p>

        <hr>
        <p>We believe in total transparency, ours is not to buy books cheaper from the seller and yet sell it expensively to the buyers, because that exploits both those who sell and those who buy</p>
